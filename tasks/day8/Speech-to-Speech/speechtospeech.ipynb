      "🤖 Hello! I am your Gemini voice assistant.\n",
      "🎙 Just speak to me. Say 'exit' or 'quit' anytime to stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "🎤 Speak now (say 'exit' to stop)...\n",
      "🗣 You said: introduction to Prompt engineering\n",
      "🔊 Gemini says: Prompt engineering is the art and science of designing effective prompts to elicit desired outputs from large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, LaMDA, and others.  It's about crafting the right questions, instructions, or requests to guide the model towards generating the specific text, code, or other content you need.  Think of it as having a conversation with a very powerful, but somewhat literal-minded, assistant.  Your ability to communicate clearly and effectively determines the quality of the results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown of key aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. The Goal:**  Before crafting a prompt, define what you want the LLM to do.  This might be:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Generating creative text:**  Writing stories, poems, scripts, articles, etc.\n",
      "* **Summarizing information:** Condensing long texts into concise summaries.\n",
      "* **Translating languages:** Converting text from one language to another.\n",
      "* **Answering questions:** Obtaining factual information or opinions.\n",
      "* **Generating code:** Creating code snippets in various programming languages.\n",
      "* **Classifying text:** Categorizing text based on certain criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Prompt Structure:**  The way you structure your prompt heavily influences the output.  Effective prompts often include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Clear Instructions:**  Specify exactly what you want the LLM to do. Use action verbs like \"summarize,\" \"translate,\" \"write,\" \"generate,\" etc.\n",
      "* **Context:**  Provide relevant background information.  The more context you give, the better the model can understand your request.\n",
      "* **Constraints:**  Set limitations on the output, such as length, format, style, or tone.  For example, \"Write a 100-word summary...\" or \"Write a poem in the style of Shakespeare...\"\n",
      "* **Examples (Few-Shot Learning):** Providing a few examples of the desired input-output pairs can significantly improve the model's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Iterative Refinement:**  Prompt engineering is an iterative process. You rarely get the perfect output on the first try.  Experiment with different phrasings, add more context, adjust constraints, and analyze the results to improve your prompts over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Techniques:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Chain-of-Thought Prompting:** Guiding the LLM through a step-by-step reasoning process to arrive at a more accurate and well-reasoned answer.\n",
      "* **Few-Shot Learning:** Providing a few examples of input-output pairs to guide the LLM's behavior.\n",
      "* **Zero-Shot Learning:**  Providing no examples, relying solely on the prompt's instructions.\n",
      "* **Prompt Engineering for Specific Tasks:** Tailoring prompts to specific tasks like question answering, text generation, code generation, etc., requires understanding the nuances of each task.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Challenges:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Ambiguity:** LLMs can struggle with vague or ambiguous prompts.\n",
      "* **Hallucinations:** LLMs can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical information.\n",
      "* **Bias:** LLMs can reflect biases present in their training data.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Summary:**  Prompt engineering is a crucial skill for anyone working with LLMs.  Mastering this skill allows you to harness the power of these models to perform a wide range of tasks efficiently and effectively. It's a continuous learning process involving experimentation and iterative refinement.\n",
